## Future Work

Some ideas to extend this project in the future:
- Real-time AI Integration: Connect the debugging assistant with open-source LLM APIs for instant student feedback.
- Multilingual Hints: Provide hints in regional languages for wider accessibility.
- Beginner vs Advanced Mode: Auto-adjust hint complexity based on user skill level.
- Web Application: Deploy as a simple web app so students can paste code and get hints instantly.
- Automated Evaluation: Add scripts for mentors to test hint quality and coverage quickly.
